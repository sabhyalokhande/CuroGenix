Team Name: InnovateX
Team Leader: Priyansh Arora

Domain: Healthcare
Problem Statement: Essential medicines such as insulin and thyroid medications frequently go out of stock without prior warning, especially at the district level. This leads to public panic, price gouging, and black-market hoarding, with no centralized mechanism to detect or act on such shortages in real time.
