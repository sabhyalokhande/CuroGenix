## ü©∫ Overview
CuroGenix is a healthcare supply intelligence platform that detects anomalies in the public medicine distribution chain. It aims to prevent black-market activities and price shortages of essential medicines in rural areas by tracking medicine allocation and raising real-time alerts to the government for necessary action.

---

**‚ùì Problem**

The government sends large quantities of essential medicines to Public Health Organizations (PHOs) and other public entities in rural areas through the pharmaceutical supply chain.

However, in many rural regions:
 - Sufficient medicines are missing from their designated locations.
 - End-users (rural citizens) often do not receive the medicines they need.
 - This leads to panic, price gouging, and black-market resale of essential drugs.

Where are these medicines going?

---

**üîç Why This Problem Exists**

- Medicines are dispatched by the government with batch numbers and assigned PHO details.
- In practice, these medicines are diverted by middlemen or fraudulent pharmacies to other unintended locations.
- As a result, PHOs don't receive their allocations, and rural patients are denied access to essential treatments.

---

**üí° Our Solution**

CuroGenix introduces a real-time medicine tracking and verification system using OCR and barcode scanning.

**How It Works:**

**1. Medicine Packaging:**
Each medicine batch has a unique barcode with key metadata (medicine name, batch number, allocated PHO).

**2. OCR & Image Scan:**
Field agents or local authorities scan the medicine using a mobile app, which:
 - Extracts details via OCR.
 - Detects the current location of the medicine.

**3. Verification Engine:**
The scanned data is verified against the central government database to:
 - Confirm whether the medicine is at its intended PHO.
 - Check for anomalies (e.g., wrong location, unallocated movement).

**4. Alert System:**
If an anomaly is detected:
 - The system flags it and alerts the government.
 - Authorities can identify the fraudulent entity (pharmacy, distributor, etc.).
 - Investigations can begin immediately to correct the supply chain breach.
